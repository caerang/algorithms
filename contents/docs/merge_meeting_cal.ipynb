    "### Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you’ll need to know when any team is having a meeting. In HiCal, a meeting is stored as a tuple ↴ of integers (start_time, end_time). These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(2, 3)  # Meeting from 10:00 – 10:30 am\n",
    "(6, 9)  # Meeting from 12:00 – 1:30 pm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function merge_ranges() that takes a list of multiple meeting time ranges and returns a list of condensed ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[(0, 1), (3, 5), (4, 8), (10, 12), (9, 10)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "your function would return:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[(0, 1), (3, 8), (9, 12)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not assume the meetings are in order. The meeting times are coming from multiple teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a solution that's efficient even when we can't put a nice upper bound on the numbers representing our time ranges. Here we've simplified our times down to the number of 30-minute slots past 9:00 am. But we want the function to work even for very large numbers, like Unix timestamps. In any case, the spirit of the challenge is to merge meetings where start_time and end_time don't have an upper bound."
